I worked as a graduate student instructor for CS 188: Introduction to Artificial Intelligence during the eight-week summer semester. I taught a one hour section to 20-30 undergraduates twice a week, organized, released, and set up automatic grading systems for the programming assigments, and contributed to exam creation.
