My name is Mike Danielczuk, and I'm a third-year PhD student in EECS at UC Berkeley.
I am advised by Professor [Ken Goldberg](http://goldberg.berkeley.edu/) of the [UC Berkeley Autolab](http://autolab.berkeley.edu/).
My work thus far has focused on robotic perception and manipulation, ranging from instance segmentation to area contact modeling and robotic pushing to increase grasp success. Specifically, I am very interested in how we can use simulation to generate large datasets for deep learning methods, thus avoiding expensive hand-labeling. I received my BSE in Electrical Engineering from Princeton University.

I also enjoy running and hiking in the many beautiful California parks around the Berkeley area, and I am an avid New England sports fan.
